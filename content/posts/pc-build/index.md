After a lot of thinking, I finally built a PC that reflects exactly what I wanted: **performance without distractions**. No RGB lights, no tempered glass panels, no flashy fans. Just raw performance, quiet operation, and clean aesthetics.

Here are the parts I chose. All links are **Amazon affiliate links**, meaning if you purchase through them, you support this blog at no additional cost to you:

- **CPU**: [Ryzen 7 5800X](https://amzn.to/3I81SWm)  
  One of the best chips from AMDâ€™s last generation. 8 cores, 16 threads, and excellent performance for gaming and productivity.

- **Motherboard**: [GIGABYTE B550M AORUS ELITE](https://amzn.to/3IdUnwU)  
  Micro-ATX with built-in WiFi. Simple, reliable, and does exactly what I need.

- **RAM**: [ORICO Raceline Racer 32 GB (2x16) 3200 MHz](https://amzn.to/3Id0i5v)  
  Solid, no-LED memory with great frequency and latency to pair with the 5800X.

- **SSD**: [SAMSUNG 990 Pro 2TB NVME](https://amzn.to/3Gof3Su)  
  Fast, silent, and spacious. No moving parts, just pure NVMe speed.

- **Power Supply**: [ASUS TUF-GAMING-750B](https://amzn.to/45RDB0s)  
  Silent, efficient, and modular. Easily handles this build and potential upgrades.

- **Graphics Card**: [ASUS Dual RTX 5070](https://amzn.to/3Gn7pI0)  
  The latest in efficient, high-performance 1440p gaming (and more). Perfect for development, AI and gaming. And best of all: **no RGB**.

Overall, this build gives me everything I need: power for development, occasional video editing, and casual gaming. All of that in a quiet, minimalist setup I truly love.

Super happy with how it turned out. I might talk more about cooling or the rest of the workspace in another post.

Thinking of building something similar? Minimal or RGB madness? Let me know!
